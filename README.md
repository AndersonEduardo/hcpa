### Here you'll find the source code for computational experiments regarding the HCPA (*High Credibility Pseudo-Absences*) framework.

**Prerequisites**

- `R` (version > 4.1) must be installed in your operational system.
- `Java` also must be installed (for running `MaxEnt`).
<!-- - Dowload the *environmental data*, using this *link*. Unzip and locate it in the folder `envdata`, in the project's main folder.
- Dowload the auxiliary data, using this *link*. Unzip and locate it in the folder `utils`, in the project's main folder. -->
