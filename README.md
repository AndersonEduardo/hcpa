# Welcome to HCPA repository

### Here you'll find the source code for computational experiments regarding the HCPA (*High Credibility Pseudo-Absences*) framework.

**Prerequisites**

- `R` (version > 4.1) must be installed in your operational system.
- `MaxEnt` software for SDM (Species Distribution Models) also must be available for running the algorithms pipeline. You can dowload it through this [link](https://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/). Unzip and place all the files in the folder `maxent` (in the project's main folder). Note that `MaxEnt` runs uppon *Java*, so you must have it installed on your operating system.
- Dowload the *environmental data*, using this link. Unzip and locate it in the folder `envdata`, in the project's main folder.
- Dowload the auxiliary data, using this link. Unzip and locate it in the folder `utils`, in the project's main folder.
